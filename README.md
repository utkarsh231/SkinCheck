# SkinCheck

**üîóThe website is live ** [here](https://skincheck.onrender.com/) **

‚úîÔ∏èCancer is a prevalent cause of mortality worldwide, with skin cancer surpassing all other cancer types combined in terms of new diagnoses in the United States. 
However, a significant portion of the population remains unaware of the disease and its implications. This project aims to address this issue by introducing a 
user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) that enables individuals of all age groups to detect and classify different types of cancer. The primary objective 
of this research is to develop innovative methodologies that allow individuals, particularly those with limited resources and medical knowledge, to gain insight 
into skin cancer diseases. By providing accessible technologies, this research endeavors to raise awareness and understanding of skin cancer among the general
population, ultimately contributing to the betterment of society.


## üî∏Problem Defeinition:-
The project focuses on the utilization of advanced deep learning techniques to develop an application capable of accurately classifying 
skin cancer from user-uploaded images. This undertaking was motivated by several identified issues that hinder the efficient classification
of skin cancer and could greatly benefit both society and researchers in the field. These include:- 

‚û°Ô∏èUnawareness of skin cancer diseases among regular people. 

‚û°Ô∏èExcessive Cost for skin cancer classification by clinicians. 

‚û°Ô∏èClinical Practices such as dermoscopy needs specialized training and experience. 

‚û°Ô∏èMost research on Skin Cancer classification lacks effectiveness and displays lower accuracy. 

‚û°Ô∏èThe lack of appropriate resources for easy skin cancer detection. 


## üî∏Solution Strategy:-
During problem definition, the main problems were discussed which occurred during the project. And in this section, the steps that were 
taken to rectify the problems will be seen. The following steps are given below: 

‚û°Ô∏è Unawareness of skin cancer diseases among regular people. 

   ‚òëÔ∏è The project helps people to classify skin cancer in one of the seven skin 
lesions with the help of just one picture. The webpage also provides the 
user with a link which redirects the user to Google for more information 
on the specified type of skin lesion. 

‚û°Ô∏è Excessive Cost for skin cancer classification by clinicians. 

   ‚òëÔ∏è The web application is free to use and available for every user. Internet 
access is just required to get the most out of the project. 

‚û°Ô∏è Clinical Practices such as dermoscopy needs specialised training and experience. 

   ‚òëÔ∏è The dataset which has been used for the training of the models is labelled 
and verified by dermatologists. Section Dataset discusses it in brief. 

‚û°Ô∏è Most research on Skin Cancer classification lacks effectiveness and displays 
lower accuracy. 

   ‚òëÔ∏è Comparison of this study with other state-of-the-art approaches on the 
same dataset showed the model used in the web application has shown 
better results than others. 

   ‚òëÔ∏è The model showed an accuracy of 87.89%. 

‚û°Ô∏è The lack of appropriate resources for easy skin cancer detection. 

   ‚òëÔ∏è Areas with lower medical advancements suffer from a lack of resources 
for easy skin cancer detection. This model is free to use with a user-friendly UI. It can be accessed by any person and is easy to use. 

üõ†Ô∏èThe project is divided into two categories ‚Äì AI and Web Technology. With the 
knowledge and literature survey of various Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning 
architectures, a model will be developed to successfully classify skin cancer disease 
using the help of labelled data from MNIST: HAM 10000. The initial part of the 
research aims at using the following architectures apart from the basic CNN models‚Äì 

‚úîÔ∏è GoogLeNet 

‚úîÔ∏è AlexNet 

After this, the concept of transfer learning was used on the dataset. It showed promising 
results. The models used for that purpose are:- 

‚úîÔ∏è InceptionNetV3 

‚úîÔ∏è Xception Net 

‚úîÔ∏è InceptionResNetV2 

The best-performing architecture was used in the latter part of the project. The Web 
Technology part includes the development of a Web Application and the integration of 
deep learning architecture with the application. An easy-to-use web design to make it 
accessible to every age group of people was intended. The web app will also provide 
information on all type of skin cancer to increase awareness. 


NOTE:- It is a SkinCancer Classification tool (not a detection tool) with an accuracy of 87.89%
